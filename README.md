# 📚 D&D Homebrew Collection

Welcome to the **D&D Homebrew Collection**. This repository serves as a centralized library for storing, versioning, and sharing custom items, weapons, armor, and rules for *Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition*.

This project is designed to be **campaign-agnostic**: the assets stored here can be dropped into any game, though they are specifically formatted to be easily linked with character management tools (such as my custom *Python CLI System*).

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The collection is organized by item type for quick navigation:

```text

├── armor/          # Light/Heavy Armor, Shields...
├── artifacts/      # Wondrous Items, Rings, Amulets...
├── consumables/    # Potions, Scrolls, Ammunition...
